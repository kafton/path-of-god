# Safe Self-Rewriting AI

This is a **safe educational AI** that simulates learning and rewriting itself.

- The AI interacts with a **simulated environment** and receives rewards.
- Based on feedback, it **updates `knowledge_score`** in its own file.
- GitHub Actions runs the AI automatically and commits updates back to the repo.
- Fully sandboxed — safe to run on GitHub.
